# **Stock Market Forecasting with LSTM**

This project aims to predict stock market prices for a variety of different time granularities. So far, we have chosen **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) models for **short-term predictions**, based on literature supporting their effectiveness for time series forecasting.

## **Project Structure**

- **Weeks 1-2**: Conduct research on stock forecasting and data analysis, and select models and data suitable for the task.
- **Week 3**: Evaluate and fine-tune models.
- **Week 4**: Create a presentation or dashboard to showcase findings.

### **Week 1 Progress Update**  
- **Model Selection**: Decided on **LSTM** for short-term stock price prediction models based on literature.
- **Feature Engineering**: Currently in progress. I am exploring ways to incorporate relevant features such as **VADER** for news sentiment analysis.
- **Market Sentiment**: Working on finding a method to capture **current market sentiment** to improve the model's accuracy.
